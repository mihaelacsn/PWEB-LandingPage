# My LandingPage
My page is about an online shop for handmade crocheted plushies and accessories.
<br>
I included in the home page some products that an user can access and see details about it.
My done pages are: 
1. Home page
2. From Home page, in the right up corner there is an icon for user. Accessing it, you get a Login page;
3. From Login page, if someone does not have an account, there if a link for Register page.
<br>
I tried to made all icons and the navigation menu clickable.
<br>
Up the page there is an annoucement bar, and at the bottom - a footer with contacts.
<br>
